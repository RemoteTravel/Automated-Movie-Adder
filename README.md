Python script to add movies to my Google Sheet for the current year

Hello! For the future, I was looking to write a Python script to do all of the data entry for me. For 3 years, I was doing it manually. Little did I know how much time I could have saved :(. As of 1/2/24, I am currently seeking employment as a software engineer or similar role. Feel free to reach out! Thank you.
